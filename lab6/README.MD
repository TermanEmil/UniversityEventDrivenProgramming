# Lab6

For this laboratory I made a [pull request](https://github.com/gzaharia/WPLabs/pull/1) to [Gabi](https://github.com/gzaharia), in which I added a gitignore and fixed a small bug in his 6th lab.

My [3rd](https://github.com/TermanEmil/UniversityEventDrivenProgramming/tree/master/lab3) laboratory was converted to C# which uses WinRT.
