# Lab6

For this laboratory I made a [pull request](https://github.com/gzaharia/WPLabs/pull/1) to my college [Gabi](https://github.com/gzaharia). With this pull request, I added a gitignore and fixed a small bug in his 6th laboratory.

My [3rd](https://github.com/TermanEmil/UniversityEventDrivenProgramming/tree/master/lab3) laboratory was converted to C# which I believe, it uses WinRT.
