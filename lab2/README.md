# Laboratory #1
In this laboratory work we had to create a basic c++ windows application with few buttons, some text and input text and play around with its parameters.

This project was successfully compiled on Windows10 CodeBlocks.

## Mandatory objectives:
* choose a Programming Style Guideline that you'll follow;
  * I did my best to follow `Google C++ Style Guide`;
  * one "public" function per file and the other functions are `static`;
  * lines no longer than 80cp;
  * functions no longer than 25 lines, with some little exceptions;
* make elements to interact or change other elements;
  * the top button, when pressed, its style is changed;
  * the bottom button, when pressed, the text from the top edit text is copied in the second one;
* change behavior of different window actions;
  * on left click: the window gets resized and repositioned;
  * on right click: the title of the main window changes to contain the position coordinates;
  * on double right click: the position is set to 0 and the window's size is changed as well;
